# Story 
        Over 400 years ago, in the kingdom of Kanto, the Dragons were considered
        to be the rulers of the world. The humans were food to the Dragons who
        flew the skies, freely dominating the lands and seas.
        However, an unknown Dragon questioned their reign and fought many battles
        to create the world we live today, where Dragons and humans coexist.

        Now, Acnologia, Self Proclaimed King of Dragons, a ruthless &
        bloodthirsty dragon slayer, who has killed any and all humans & dragons he could,
        ignoring the fact that many were his comrades,
        believes he is the rightful ruler of this world and has gathered
        followers with similar mindset to set out on the journey to kill the King
        of Kanto and re-built the world under his evil guidance.

        Your job is to stop Acnologia from reaching the Kingâ€™s Palace and
        defeat him to bring peace back to the world.
