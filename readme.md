        The following information will be useful:

        Dragon are very powerful beings in the Kingdom of Kanto. They terrorized
        the World 400 years ago. Humans were food to the dragons. But an Unknown
        Dragon, realized this as wrong doing and taught some humans magic to defeat dragons.
        Each of those humans were implanted with a special elemental(such as fire, water, etc) seed
        which made those humans Dragon Slayers.

        Each Dragon Slayer is of different type. For eg: If some one is a Shadow Dragon Slayer, He can
        slay a Shadow Dragon with relative ease as compared to other type of Dragon. Alternatively, a Shadow Dragon
        Slayer will be weak against a Light Dragon.

    
# Story 
        Over 400 years ago, in the kingdom of Kanto, the Dragons were considered
        to be the rulers of the world. The humans were food to the Dragons who
        flew the skies, freely dominating the lands and seas.
        However, an unknown Dragon questioned their reign and fought many battles
        to create the world we live today, where Dragons and humans coexist.

        Now, Acnologia, Self Proclaimed King of Dragons, a ruthless &
        bloodthirsty dragon slayer, who has killed any and all humans & dragons he could,
        ignoring the fact that many were his comrades,
        believes he is the rightful ruler of this world and has gathered
        followers with similar mindset to set out on the journey to kill the King
        of Kanto and re-built the world under his evil guidance.

        Your job is to stop Acnologia from reaching the King’s Palace and
